# Plan for Chemical Compound Visualization Tool

## 1. Technology Stack Selection
- Frontend: React with TypeScript for the user interface
- Visualization: SVG-based rendering for molecular structures
- Chemical Data: PubChem API for retrieving compound information
- Molecular Rendering: React implementation with SVG elements

## 2. Project Setup
1. A React application with TypeScript
2. Required dependencies installation
3. Basic project structure

## 3. Implementation Components

### A. Chemical Compound Input Interface
- Create a search input for chemical compound names
- Add validation for input names
- Implement autocomplete suggestions if possible

### B. Chemical Data Retrieval System
- Create a service to query PubChem API
- Parse and extract structural data
- Establish error handling for compounds not found

### C. SVG Visualization Component
- Implement SVG-based molecular rendering with:
  - Proper atom colors following standard chemical representation
  - Clear representation of bonds between atoms
  - Element labels positioned next to each atom
  - Multiple viewing angles pre-rendered as SVGs

### D. Interactive Controls
- Implement animation between different viewing angles to simulate rotation
- Add zoom functionality for SVG elements
- Create options to customize visualization style
- Include a play/pause button for animation sequence

### E. Enhancement Features
- Implement a "screenshot" feature
- Add ability to download the SVG files
- Include detailed chemical information panel

## 4. Prompt Enhancement for SVG Generation

When generating the SVG visualization, we'll ensure the following conditions:

```
Visualization Prompt Conditions:
1. Model accuracy:
   - Ensure correct bond angles based on chemical structure
   - Maintain proper atom sizes relative to each other
   - Use standard CPK coloring (O=red, H=white, C=gray, N=blue, etc.)

2. Rotation simulation parameters:
   - Generate multiple SVG views from different angles (at least 8 perspectives)
   - Create smooth transitions between views
   - Set default transition speed between views (1 complete cycle per 30 seconds)
   - Allow user-adjustable transition speed

3. Element labeling:
   - Position element symbols at consistent distance from atom centers
   - Use high-contrast colors for labels (black on light background, white on dark)
   - Implement dynamic label sizing based on zoom level
   - Allow toggling labels on/off
   - Include options for different label types (element symbol, element name, atomic number)

4. Visual enhancement:
   - Use gradient fills for atoms to give a 3D appearance
   - Apply subtle shadows to enhance depth perception
   - Implement proper layering of atoms (atoms in front should overlap atoms behind)
   - Use varying stroke widths for showing depth

5. User interaction adaptations:
   - Pause animation when user manually changes view
   - Resume animation after a period of inactivity
   - Allow clicking on atoms to show detailed information
```

## 5. Implementation Steps

Implementation will involve creating the following files:

1. Basic project setup with React and TypeScript
2. API service for chemical data retrieval
3. SVG-based molecule visualization components
4. User interface for search and controls
5. Detailed documentation
